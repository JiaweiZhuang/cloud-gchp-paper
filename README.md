# Code to reproduce GCHP-on-cloud paper

This repository serves as a permanent archive for the GCHP-on-cloud paper, using a frozen model version (12.3.2). This study focuses on computational performance, and only performs a sanity check on the scientific results.

The operational support for serious research use is planned after version 13.0.0 release and will be added to https://github.com/geoschem/geos-chem-cloud. That will have constant version updates and more rigorous scientific validation.
